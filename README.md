# Minimal NeoVim

## What this config aims
The goal of this custom neovim config is to provide a bare minimun set of configurations for a non-professional developer to carry out his projects in a more efficient way.

## What it includes
[x] Copilot

[x] Treesitter for better highlighting

[x] Code formatter (Working on it)

[x] Telescope with a couple of simple keybinds

[x] Lualine statusbar

[x] Dracula theme

[x] Transparency (if not desired, just comment a single line of code)

[x] Full lua config structure

## What it won't include

[ ] LSP completions (You have copilot + google, no need for more)

[ ] Fancy menus everywhere

[ ] Unlimited set of default keybindings you will never learn (you have the bare minimun ultra basics, you can always add more)
